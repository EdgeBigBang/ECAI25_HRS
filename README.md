This is the official PyTorch implementation of the ECAI 2025 paper "HRS: Hybrid Representation Framework with Scheduling Awareness for Time Series Forecasting in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms".

## üìñ Paper Introduction

HRS is an innovative hybrid representation learning framework specifically designed for time series forecasting tasks in crowdsourced cloud-edge platforms. The framework combines the advantages of numerical and image representations while introducing a scheduling-aware loss function to optimize prediction performance.

## üèóÔ∏è Framework Architecture

The HRS framework consists of three core components:

1. **Image Representation Conversion**: Transforms numerical time series into image representations
2. **Hybrid Feature Learning**: Extracts features from both numerical and image inputs and fuses them
3. **Scheduling-Aware Loss**: Guides learning through asymmetric penalties

## üöÄ Quick Start
